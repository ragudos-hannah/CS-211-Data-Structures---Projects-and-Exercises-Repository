# CS 211 Data Structures - Projects and Exercises Repository

## Description

Welcome to my comprehensive repository, chronicling my journey through CS 211 - Data Structures, in my second year at **Saint Louis University**. This repository is a testament to my academic growth, showcasing my transition from understanding basic data structures to mastering complex algorithms and their applications in solving real-world problems.

## Contents & Learning Journey

### Prelim Period
#### 1. **Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis**
   - **Key Learnings**: Understanding the significance of data structures and algorithms in computing, exploring basic data types, abstract data types, and the problem-solving process.
   - **Project Insight**: Analysis and implementation of basic algorithms, understanding their complexity using Big O notation.
   - **Resources**: Introduction to lectures on data structures and algorithm complexity. [Data Structures and Algorithms in Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/index.html)

#### 2. **List Data Structures**
   - **Key Learnings**: Implementation and manipulation of list data structures, including arrays and linked lists (singly, doubly, circular).
   - **Project Insight**: Practical applications involving list operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
   - **Resources**: Collaborative and individual programming projects focusing on list data structures. [Java Documentation on Collections](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/collections/overview.html)


### Midterm Period
#### 3. **Stack and Queue Data Structures**
   - **Key Learnings**: Concepts and applications of stack and queue data structures.
   - **Project Insight**: Development of applications using stacks and queues to solve specific problems.
   - **Resources**: Projects on implementing and applying stacks and queues in various scenarios. [Introduction to the Java Stack/Queue API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/queue.html)

#### 4. **Tree Data Structures**
   - **Key Learnings**: Exploration of tree data structures, including binary trees, tree traversal methods, binary search trees, and Huffman coding.
   - **Project Insight**: Implementation of tree operations and applications such as Huffman coding.
   - **Resources**: Group programming projects on tree data structures and their applications. Engaged with Chapter 8, "Data Structures and Algorithms in Java"

### Finals Period
#### 5. **Graph Data Structures**
   - **Key Learnings**: Understanding graph data structures, their representations, traversal methods, and shortest path algorithms.
   - **Project Insight**: Applications involving graph data structures to solve problems like finding shortest paths.
   - **Resources**: Colleague's presentations and programming projects on graphs and their applications.  [Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)

#### 6. **Hashing and Collision Handling**
   - **Key Learnings**: Principles of hashing, hash tables, and strategies for handling collisions.
   - **Project Insight**: Exploration of hashing functions and collision handling techniques in data storage and retrieval.
   - **Resources**: Discussions on hashing, its importance, and methods to address collision issues.

## Methodologies

- Active participation in **Lectures** for theoretical and practical knowledge.
